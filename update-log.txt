1. fixed slight code error in specify units in embedding layers.
   dennybritz code specified this parameter in the training file, however, 
   in the GRUTheano class file, it wasn't used. Instead the number of units
   for the GRU layers was used as the corresponding number of units for the
   embedding layer.
