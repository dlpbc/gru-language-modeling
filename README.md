# Language Modeling on Locally curated dataset
An interesting project that entails training neural net language model on a locally curated dataset. See below or [here](https://github.com/dlpbc/datasets/blob/master/README.md#nairaland-featured-links) for description of the dataset.

## Dataset - 5k featured links on nairaland
- 5000 sentences
- One sentence per line
- Each sentence is the title of a featured link thread on [nairaland](http://nairaland.com)

## Network Description
2 Layer Gated Recurrent Units (GRU). A slightly modified version of what was implemented [here](https://github.com/dennybritz/rnn-tutorial-gru-lstm). 

## Network Configuration
- 500 units word embedding layer  
- 400 gru units per gru layer
-vocabulary size: 500
- initial learning rate: 0.008 (annealed over epochs down to 0.00001)
- number of epochs: 115

## Network Performance
- 0.92 loss after 115 epochs (Pre-trained model located in **trained_model_param** directory.

## Usage
- Train Model
```
python train_gru_rnn.py
```

- Generate sentences (featured links) from pre-trained model
```
python sentence_generator.py
```

## Some Sample Sentences (featured links) Generated by trained model
- what to do during asuu strike
- nigeria vs cameroon : who is your man of the strike ?
- see new fayose for president 2019 today
- a nairalander 's pre-wedding photos
- how much do you members ways things ?
